GETTING STARTED WITH Git 

**You dont need to clone the node modules because the package.json file
  contains all the needed libraries in there. After cloning the files from 
  git onto your local station, you can just run npm install and it should
  instlall all the dependencies from package.json.**

  - Install Git onto windows
    - once installed, go to the environmental variables
      - Path
        - Add these 2 paths on there if not already
          - C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
          - C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe
  
  - Once done, you can go to vs code and create a .gitignore file 
    - in this case, we are ignoring all the items within the node_modules folder
      so in that .gitignore file, we will specify the /node_modules
    - open terminal and run the following command
      - git init

    - May need to set my email by running the command,
      - config --global user.email "moua.kong95@gmail.com"
      - config --global user.name "Kongmeng Moua"
      - git commit -m "first commit" //to run


  **if there are changes to a file, you will need to do the following**
    - git add note.txt
      - git init
    
    - git commit -m "first commit"
      - git init
        - git add .
          - git remote add orgin https://github.com/mouakong95/tempRepo.git
            - git branch -M main
              - git push -u orgin main

  **Pushing update to Git**
    git add .
    git commit -m "any message here"
    git push -u orgin main

  **FORCING A PUSH TO GIT**
    git push -f orgin main

**NPM***

  - Running the npm command and adding a -D at the end labels that 
    package as a devDependencies. 
      - devDependencies: Lets the package know that this is only used
        when developing but will not be used in production.

  - **package.json (scripts)**
    - under scripts you can create your own custom scripts to start or 
      run something.
        - Ex: i have "start": "node app.js"
          - When i run "npm start" it will trigger the command  
            "node app.js"
    - Uninstalling packages
      - npm uninstall fileNameHere
